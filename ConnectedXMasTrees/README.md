Connected XMas Trees

Using MQTT, two WeMos D1 Minis can connect via an MQTT broker to interact.

Details for this project will be published on element14.com

ConnectedXmasWitty = The project I used for testing. It runs on a Witty WiFi, which is similar to the WeMos D1 Mini,
but includes a push button and several useful LEDs. This makes testing easy in that there is no hardware component to deal with.

ConnectedXmasWeMos = The project I'm using with the actual flashing LED xmas trees.
